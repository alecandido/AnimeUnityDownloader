## Single Anime Download

To download a single anime, you can use the `anime_downloader.py` script.

### Usage

Run the script followed by the anime URL you want to download:

```bash
python3 anime_downloader.py <anime_url> [--start <start_episode>] [--end <end_episode>]
```

- `<anime_url>`: The URL of the anime series.
- `--start <start_episode>`: The starting episode number (optional).
- `--end <end_episode>`: The ending episode number (optional).

### Examples

To download all episodes:
```bash
python3 anime_downloader.py https://www.animeunity.so/anime/1517-yuru-yuri
```

To download a specific range of episodes (e.g., episodes 5 to 10):
```bash
python3 anime_downloader.py https://www.animeunity.so/anime/1517-yuru-yuri --start 5 --end 10
```

To download episodes starting from a specific episode:
```bash
python3 anime_downloader.py https://www.animeunity.so/anime/1517-yuru-yuri --start 5
```
In this case, the script will download all episodes starting from the `--start` episode to the last episode.

To download episodes up to a certain episode:
```bash
python3 anime_downloader.py https://www.animeunity.so/anime/1517-yuru-yuri --end 10
```
In this case, the script will download all episodes starting from the first episode to the `--end` episode.

## Batch Download

### Usage

1. Create a `URLs.txt` file in the project root and list the anime URLs you want to download.

- Example of `URLs.txt`:

```
https://www.animeunity.so/anime/1517-yuru-yuri
https://www.animeunity.so/anime/3871-chainsaw-man
https://www.animeunity.so/anime/2598-made-in-abyss
```

- Ensure that each URL is on its own line without any extra spaces.
- You can add as many URLs as you need, following the same format.

2. Run the main script via the command line:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The downloaded files will be saved in the `Downloads` directory.
